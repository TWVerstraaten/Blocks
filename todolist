Set max character count on CommandEditWidget

Implement the following commands:
    set var_name value_type
    var_name += value_type
    var_name -= value_type
    var_name *= value_type
    var_name /= value_type
here value_type should be one of Integer | { SIZE } | declared var_name

Some sort of winning condition

SPL should cut and kill what was cut,
CUT should just split the cluster and keep all alive
GRB should grab what is alive nearby and pause those clusters
